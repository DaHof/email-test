	CHOOSING THE DOCTYPE:
	XHTML Strict or Transitional are common choices. HTML5 can also be used when using specific HTML5 features like video.
	Note: Some email clients force their own doctype regardless of what's set and some will even remove it entirely.

				FORCING THE DOCUMENT MODE FOR INTERNET EXPLORER BASED EMAIL CLIENTS:
				https://www.campaignmonitor.com/forums/topic/7989
				http://blog.jmwhite.co.uk/2014/03/01/windows-phone-does-support-css3-media-queries-in-html-email
				http://blog.jmwhite.co.uk/2014/08/19/email-campaigns-windows-phone-part-2-pop3-and-imap
				http://www.emailonacid.com/blog/details/C13/designing_html_emails_for_outlook_2003_and_outlook_express
				https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-development/prevent-ie-edge-meta-tag-from-breaking-images-in-live-mail
				This will force any Internet Explorer (IE) based email client to render at the highest standards possible.
				Major email clients that are IE based and benefit from the document mode being forced to edge include:
				* Windows Phone 7.8
				* Windows Phone 8.0
				* Windows Phone 8.1
				* Outlook Express
				* Outlook 2000/2002/2003
				* Windows Live Mail
				* Windows 8 Metro Mail App (Touch based)
				Generally these clients will render with an IE document mode that's less than optimal.
				The meta tag sets the document mode to edge meaning the highest possible rendering capabilities are used
				Windows Phone benefits greatly from this due to the use of the IE7 document mode by default (Nice one Microsoft)
				CAVEATS:
				The inclusion of this meta tag has been known to mess with Outlook 2003 and breaking printing functionality.
				Windows Live Mail also has issues with images when the edge document mode is used
				If you need to support these clients you should consider using the compatibility fix rather than the standard implementation
			-->

			<!-- Standard implementation -->
			<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />

			<!-- 
				Compatibility implementation
				Prevents functionality isuses in Outlook 2003 and Windows Live Mail
				An empty comment is used to prevent Outlook.com from messing with it
			-->
            
			<!--[if !mso]><!-->
			<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
			<!--<![endif]-->


			<!-- 
				VIEWPORT SETTING:
				https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag
				http://www.emailonacid.com/blog/details/C13/emailology_viewport_metatag_rendered_unusable
				Mainly for mobile devices to set the view correctly when using media queries.
				This does however have implications for older BlackBerry devices.
				Not including it however can make some mobile email clients render the desktop version or appear zoomed out.
			-->
			<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />

			<!--
				DOCUMENT TITLE:
				Not all email clients will use the title tag, however for those that do it can be used to reinforce the purpose of the email. 
				Another example of when the title is used would be the web version of your email campaign.
			
				If in doubt, use the name of your organisation as a generic fallback to prevent "Untitled Document" or blank titles.
			-->
			<title>Central College Nottingham</title>
             
			<!--
				FAVICON:
				For the web version of the email, you can make use of a favicon much like a website
			-->
			<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="http://www.centralnottingham.ac.uk/favicon.ico" />

			<!--
				CASCADING STYLE SHEETS:
				http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css
				http://templates.mailchimp.com/development/css
				Email clients and CSS support vary massively.
				Most CSS should be inline due to limitations with CSS in the <head> in some clients.
				The exception to this is reset styles or fixes that target a specific client that does render CSS in the <head>.
				Forget calling external style sheets, most email clients won't even parse it.

						With Outlook 2007 - 2013, display:none; works but not if there is a table within the element you are trying to hide.
						In order to hide content, you have to use a combination of CSS properties for maximum compatibility these include:
						* display:none; 
						* font-size:0; 
						* max-height:0; 
						* line-height:0;
						* overflow:hidden;
						* visibility:hidden;
						* mso-hide:all; (Specific MSO property for Outlook)
						
						You then need to override each property used in a media query to make them show when the mobile layout is used.

				When using scaling factors greater than 100% (96 DPI) Outlook often displays images incorrectly.
				This Microsoft Office specific XML forces images to be rendered at 96 PPI, making them display correctly.
				Outlook 2007 doesn't quite render images properly at 96 PPI and still enlarges them slightly.

			Text that appears after the subject line in a preview/notification in the inbox.
			Not creating a preheader means generally the first bit of text content gets used. 
			This can be bad when areas like the web version link are first.
			The preheader can be visible but if a template design doesn't allow for it the hidden span technique can be used.
			display:none !important; allows Gmail to hide the span without max-height hacks.
			In case display:none; doesn't work, color and font-size properties can be used to still "hide" the span content.
			The font colour would match the background colour of the email.
			Note: Setting a very small font size can trigger some spam filters.

			TABLE LAYOUT:
			Basic table layout to adapt for your campaign with some general guidance.
			1. Start with a 100% width table to force covering the entire email space available in various clients
			2. Nest a container table within the wrapper table which will hold the email template
				2a. The container should be no greater than 600 pixels wide.
				2b. Never define widths as px values on a table width attribute. Either percentage or a number only.
			3. When using a pixel width value, a matching CSS width property should be applied for better HiDPI support in Outlook 07-13

					ALIGNING LAYOUTS TO THE CENTRE:
					In some cases, you may want the whole email layout to be centred (mainly for desktop clients).
					Using the wrapping table cell approach is a clean way of doing it, removing the need for any <center> or <div> tags.
					It does mean however you'll need to use the align attribute on all table cells within to avoid content being centered.

						https://www.campaignmonitor.com/guides/mobile
						When creating an email campaign there are several approaches you can take when developing the layout.
						The approach used is often dependant on the design of the email campaign itself.
						Fixed width layouts are common, but require the need of media query support to optimise them for mobile devices.
						The scalable/fluid approach removes the requirement for media query support but can force certain design requirements.
                        
						This layout uses the fixed width approach by default.

									* Absolute images paths, http:// only
									* Always set a width and height that is EXACTLY the same values of the dimensions of the image
									* Apply display:block; to fix various image gap problems in various email clients
									* Set a good and relevant alternative text value as well. You can even style this text in some clients
									* Outlook 2013 will add spacing underneath images that are less than 20px in height
									* Hide blue hyperlink borders with border="0" as border:none; isn't as reliable.

			GMAIL iOS APP FONT SIZING FIX:
			http://freshinbox.com/blog/gmail-on-ios-increases-font-size-on-some-emails
			
			The Gmail iOS app likes to mess around with font sizes. It increases font sizes to make them more legable on mobile.
			It can however have very unpredictable results and break email templates or make them look worse.
			Using either of the two methods below leverages a email width check to prevent the font sizing behaviour occurring.

		FILESIZE OF YOUR EMAIL TEMPLATE:

		https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/3610/maximum-file-size-for-html-email
		With email, size really does matter. If the filesize of your HTML template is greater than 100kb, prepare for problems.
		Sending a HTML email template greater than 100kb can cause several problems in relation to deliverability and user experience including:
		* Triggering spam filters
		* Email clipping/truncation
		* Load time
		For larger emails where this is an issue, you can use a couple of techniques to get under the limit:
		* Remove any unnecessary spaces, carriage returns or comments
		* Remove redundant or unnecessary styles
		You could also use a more automated approach with minification tools, such as:
		https://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor
		If you use automated tools, make sure to preserve white space.
